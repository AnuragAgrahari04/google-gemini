## üåü About The Project

This project serves as a powerful demonstration of the capabilities of Google's next-generation multimodal AI, Gemini. It provides a simple yet effective user interface created with Streamlit to interact with both the text-based `Gemini Pro` and the image-understanding `Gemini Pro Vision` models.

You can ask complex questions, get detailed explanations, and even upload images to have the AI describe and analyze them.

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **Conversational AI**: Engage in dynamic, context-aware conversations.
* **Image Analysis**: Upload an image and ask questions about it. The AI can describe the contents, identify objects, and answer context-specific queries.
* **Interactive UI**: A clean and user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.
* **Multimodal Input**: Seamlessly switch between text-only and text-with-image prompts.

### üõ†Ô∏è Built With

This project is built using modern and efficient technologies:

* **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**
* **[Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/)** (`google-generativeai`)
* **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)**
* **[Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/)** (for image handling)

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
* **Python 3.8+**
* A **Google API Key**. You can obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/AnuragAgrahari04/google-gemini.git](https://github.com/AnuragAgrahari04/google-gemini.git)
    cd google-gemini
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```sh
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project directory and add your Google API Key:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
